AI-powered Resume Reviewer — Backend Code (Node.js)
We’ll build:

A server with Express.js

Save resumes and feedback in MongoDB

Use OpenAI API to analyze uploaded resumes

Accept file uploads (e.g., .txt)
Step 1: Setup your project
Open terminal:

bash
Copy code
mkdir ai-resume-reviewer
cd ai-resume-reviewer
npm init -y
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install express mongoose dotenv openai multer cors
folder structure 
ai-resume-reviewer/
├── app.js
├── .env
├── models/
│   └── Resume.js
├── routes/
│   └── resume.js
├── controllers/
│   └── resumeController.js
├── uploads/     <-- where resumes are saved
Step 8: Test it
1️⃣ Run MongoDB locally.
2️⃣ Start the server:

bash
Copy code
node app.js
3️⃣ Use Postman or curl:

POST http://localhost:5000/api/resume/upload

Body → form-data → Key: resume → choose a .txt file

✅ You’ll get JSON like:

json
Copy code
{
  "message": "✅ Resume reviewed successfully",
  "feedback": "Your resume looks good. Here are some improvements: ..."
}
{
You’ll get JSON like:
  "message": "✅ Resume reviewed successfully",
  "feedback": "Your resume looks good. Here are some improvements: ..."
}
🪛 Done!
🎯 We now have:

A REST API backend

AI-powered resume review with OpenAI

MongoDB for persistence

Upload support
